"Despite Daughter Three's insistence on formalities, there is no need for special treatment. We all must eat, so we all share food."

P: I nod, and regurgitate some of the contents of my stomach.

P: She asks for no special treatment, but I can't help but give up a larger portion than I usually would to another sister.

If she notices, she does not comment.

P: Mother partakes of her meal in small sips and licks, seemingly in no hurry.

"Not mine. Certainly not yours. It is OUR name!"

"The weight of a name is heavy. It is one we carry together, or not at all."

"It is our self, and our path. Our purpose, and our spirit."

"So we have lifted this weight from your shoulders."

P: I feel as heavy as ever.

"You have been unburdened: Stand up."

P: ...And I suppose I did crumple to the floor at some point.

P: Sister Superior Three offers a hand.

The Queen Mother motions, and she retracts her offer.

P: I don't need her help anyway. I can stand on my own legs.

"Our daughters will allow you safe passage, of course."

P: You'll forgive me if I gloss over the finer details of life in exile.

P: Not nearly as romantic as it sounds.

I'm not much different than you, or anyone else here, for that matter. It just took me a bit longer to make my way.

P: Sure, sometimes there's that awkward moment, meeting someone on the road: We say our greetings, they introduce themselves, and I dodge the response.

P: But you'd be surprised how many travelers are content in their anonymity, and see no reason to question yours.
>
P: What's more important, really?
>
P: A handful of words you'll use once and forget, or a warm meal after a long day?
>
P: Something to call yourself, or knowing who you are?

P: A legacy, or a life?

P: ...No, don't- It's rhetorical.

::They never really took it from me.
P: Sister Twenty of Many Oecophylla, at your service. Twenny if you're in a hurry.

P: What are they going to do, hunt me down? Arrest me for disobedience and kick me out again?
>
P: No, Mother's finished with me. Haven't even seen another Oecophylla since then.
>
P: She- no, all of them, they were so concerned with what it meant to be one.

To be Many!
>
P: Why let them decide? It's mine as much as theirs.
>
P: That's something I'm not sure they ever understood: The name, the path, the life - it's something we share, not something we are.
>
P: Sometimes wish I had known how to make them see that.
>
P: ...Not that it matters now.
